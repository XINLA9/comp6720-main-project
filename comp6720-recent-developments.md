# Recent developments

This is an extra task specifically for students enrolled in the masters course (COMP6720). Students in the undergraduate course (COMP1720) can ignore this file.

This work reflects the latest developments in the field of art and interactive computing, especially in the area of immersive art and multi-scene interaction. In recent years, interactive art has evolved from a single experience to a multi-level, interdimensional experience. My work connects four scenes into a whole through the vehicle of a train, and uses a dynamic portal system to embody the instantaneous transformation between multiple dimensions.

In addition, with advances in artificial intelligence and dynamic perception technology, my interactive design encourages the viewer to empathize with the environment in multiple ways. This is in line with the current trend in art to make the viewer no longer a spectator in the digital space, but a subject who co-constructs the experience with the work of art. This interactivity and diversity is the latest development reflected in my work.

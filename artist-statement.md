# Artist Statement

Write your artist statement in this file (max 300 words).

Answer the following:

- How would you would like viewers to perceive the major project theme in your work?
- How does interaction enhance the viewerâ€™s experience?

In my digital artwork The Train Out of Time and Space, I explore the entangled relationship between reality and illusion, time and space. My goal is to allow the audience to experience the flow of time and the diversity of the world in an immersive way - a magical train that travels through several scenes including forest, universe, desert and ocean. Each scene not only has a unique visual and atmosphere, but also is designed to require the audience to participate in the interaction, revealing the hidden portal to more magical scenes.

I want the audience to feel connected to the scene through the interaction. Each interaction is not only an exploration, but also an experience of different worldviews. In the forest, they will discover hidden life, understand the beauty of loneliness in the universe, experience the merciless time in the desert, and explore the unknown possibilities in the depths of the ocean. The interactive design guides the audience from onlookers to participants, and only through exploration and thinking can they discover the next scene towards which the train is heading.

I hope that this work will inspire the viewer to break with the conventional perception of time and space, and bring about reflections on multi-dimensional existence and complex relationships. It is not only an artistic journey, but also a speculative experience about existence and entanglement.

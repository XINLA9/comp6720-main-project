If you want to explain how your work should be interacted with, or if there are any complicated or hidden features, feel free to explain them here.

- Use the arrow keys ↑ and ↓ to adjust the formal speed of the train
- After entering a new scene, you may need to complete certain tasks to trigger the portal, which require you to interact with the object in the scene. On other occasions, you do not need to do anythings, just need to enjoy the scene and wait for the portal present.
- Interact with objects in the scene through the click of the mouse, and when the cursor is moved over the object that can be interacted with, the object will be marked with a white border. For example,  the sun, moon, mountain, and pyramids in the desert scene are all interactive on certain occasions.
- The interaction of the ocean scene is mainly with the note graphics at the top of the screen, which make music when they collide with each other and the boundaries and generate water plants in different worlds, the notes evade the cursor, and the ripples that activate the notes when the mouse clicks
- Ocean Scene recommends wearing headphones to enjoy a special symphony
